 GGG  raph Truncation and Cross Graph References

Graph truncation will cause a loader graph to destroy (or truncate) a node and
remove all of its successors. Imagine a program which modifies the destination
of a jump instruction, causing a portion of an existing graph to become
invalid.

The decision becomes what to do with cross graph references, for example a call
to another function, in portions of the graph that will become truncated.
If the targeted function is targeted solely from the truncated portion of the
graph, what happens to this function?

    No change to the function
    Function is removed
    Function remains but has some indicator that it is no longer referenced
