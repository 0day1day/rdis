ALPHA CHARLIE
- Internally reworked loaders to disassemble from a memory map instead of
	the file stored internally.
- Threaded function discovery and disassembly for all internally implemented
	loaders (ELF32, ELF64, PE).
- Remove Function added to function window
- Changing the content of rdis' representation of memory triggers regraphing of
  	functions where the change intersects or falls within the functions lowest
  	upper and greatest lower bounds.
- rdis is now linked against luajit instead of lua


PURPOSE OF THIS RELEASE
	Test validity of runtime graph manipulations
